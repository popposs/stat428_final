## STAT 428 Final Project

### Part 1 Setup (Ubuntu or OSX)
0. Make sure you have Python3 installed.
1. `cd part1/`
2. `pip3 -r install requirements.txt` to install package dependencies.
3. `python3 main.py` to start the simulation (may need to fiddle with the code; commented some stuff out).

## Part 1 Static Plots (Error and MC Simulation)
* Error plots found in `part1/mc_error`
* Simulation plots found in `part1/mc_states`
##### Note: You can change the computed state in the main function by changing the name. Ex: 'Texas' or 'Vermont'. You can also change number of Montecarlo iterations.
